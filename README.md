# EmbeddedCommunicationExample
Intra-System Communication demo run on the D'Agostino Learning Systems training board. I've created a PC GUI developed in Python using PyQT5 packages for PC -> Learning Module communication. I've included basic features such as toggling LEDs from remote modules and using the remote 8-seg LED displays, but more functionality can be added if neccesarry.
